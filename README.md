# Ebay Browse API SDK for PHP
Using the Browse API, you can create a rich selection of items for your buyers to browse with keyword and category searches.

- API version: v1.20.2

## Requirements

- PHP 8.1 and later
- ext-json and ext-curl extensions enabled

## Installation & Usage

Install the package using composer:

```sh
composer require sapientpro/ebay-browse-sdk-php
```

## Getting Started

Please follow the [installation procedure](#installation--usage) and then run the following:

```php
<?php
use SapientPro\EbayBrowseSDK\Configuration;
use SapientPro\EbayBrowseSDK\Api\ItemApi;
use SapientPro\EbayBrowseSDK\Models\CompatibilityPayload;

// Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: api_auth
$config = Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()->setAccessToken('YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN');

$apiInstance = new ItemApi(
config: $config
);
// you can create and fill a Model class that implements EbayModelInterface using fromArray() method
// exception will be thrown if a property does not exist in the model class
$body = CompatibilityPayload::fromArray([]);

try {
$result = $apiInstance->checkCompatibility($body);
print_r($result);
} catch (Exception $e) {
echo 'Exception when calling InventoryItemApi->bulkCreateOrReplaceInventoryItem: ', $e->getMessage(), PHP_EOL;
}
```

## Creating Models

Some SDK methods require `$body` variable as a parameter. It refers to a Model class that implements EbayModelInterface.
There are several ways to create a Model class:

### fromArray()
You can create a Model class using fromArray() method.
It will throw an exception if a property does not exist in the model class.

If the model has a property of type that implements EbayModelInterface, you must create an instance of that class using fromArray() method.
In this example, the property `price` is of type `ConvertedAmount` that also implements EbayModelInterface.

```php
Item::fromArray([
    'price' => ConvertedAmount::fromArray([
        'value' => '6.90',
        'currency' => CurrencyCodeEnum::USD
    )]
])
```
### fromPlainArray()

It is also possible to create a Model from plain associative array.
The previous example can be rewritten as follows:

```php
Item::fromPlainArray([
    'price' => [
        'value' => '6.90',
        'currency' => CurrencyCodeEnum::USD
    ]
])
```

### fromJson()

It is also possible to create a Model from JSON string.

```php
Item::fromJson('{"price": {"value": "6.90", "currency": "USD"}}')
```

An item group is  an item that has various aspect differences, such as color, size, storage capacity, etc. When an item group is created, one of the item variations, such as the red shirt size L, is chosen as the &quot;parent&quot;. All the other items in the group are the children, such as the blue shirt size L, red shirt size M, etc. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;tablenote&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt; Note: &lt;/b&gt; This container is returned only if the &lt;b&gt; item_id&lt;/b&gt; in the request is an item group (parent ID of an item with variations).&lt;/span&gt; |
